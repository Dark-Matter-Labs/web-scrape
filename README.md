# Web Scraper using Puppeteer JS

This is a simple web scraping application built with Puppeteer JS, which is a Node library that provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer is often used for browser automation, performance monitoring, and of course, scraping content from web pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you'll need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

### Installing Node.js and npm

To install Node.js and npm, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the version appropriate for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm.
4. To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

5. To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm -v
```

## Installation

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can set up the web scraper by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have the source code using your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Puppeteer and other required packages as defined in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

To start the web scraper, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

This command will initiate the script defined in `app.js`, which should contain your web scraping logic using Puppeteer.

## Important Notes

- The web scraper is built for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and ethically.
- Make sure you have permission to scrape the website and that you comply with the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service.
- Be aware that web scraping can be legally complex. Ensure you understand the legal implications of scraping data from websites.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the application, ensure that:

- Your Node.js and npm versions are up to date.
- All dependencies are correctly installed in the node_modules folder.
- The website you are trying to scrape does not have anti-bot measures that may block Puppeteer.
